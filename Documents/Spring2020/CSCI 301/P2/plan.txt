1. Summary: We will be creating 8 functions in order to become familiar with formal grammer,
context free grammar, and regular grammar. The first 4 functions will help us to learn about
the types of inputs that grammers take and the rules that they use to determine which inputs 
are accepted and rejected. Functions 5-7 attempt to differentiate the types of grammer 
(formal, context, regular), using the first 4 functions to evaluate the elements. We are 
being asked to correlate the elements of grammers in order to better understand their 
functionality. We will go about implementing these functions systematicly. First we will implement
functions 1-4 using list?, car, cdr, cons, and cond to get the elements. For function 5, we will 
be using the first 4 functions and helper functions to implement and test. We will use cond 
statements to check each property and stop checking when we get a false statement. We will use 
map or recursion in order to efficiently solve the problem. For function 6, we will use part of 
function 5 in order to see if it is formal grammer and then we will check the formal grammer 
guide for the next properties. This will be implemented with recursion or mapping and conds. 
For 7 we will use function 6 as a conds case and then check the grammer guide for the next properties.

2. The most challenging aspect of this process may be understanding what it means for the function to 
be context free and using map and recursion to find compinations and use rules. It may also be scary 
connecting everything together. 

3. Mentor hours, office hours, buddies in the class

4. We will be checking in every morning and planning a time for us to meet for at least one hour each day.
